# Burger Kitchen by Zhi Zeng

When I think of regular traditional games, board games and table-top games instantly comes to my mind. This game that I created combines basic components from different existing board/table-top games in order to create a new unique and fun board game. Such elements includes the Card systems from the Uno game, and the Board systems from Monopoly. 

## Overview
In this game, you are a chef managing a burger kitchen. You compete with other players to become the best burger kitchen. The core objective is to collect essential ingredient cards from the different shops on the board. Once you have collected the four essential ingredients, you must return to your kitchen in order to "complete" a burger and earn points.

* Number of Players: 2-4
